# Greeting, I'm Brenno Brandalise Demarchi, it's nice to see you here!

> [!text] This is not a curriculum, although it is

Inspired by the principles of Digital Gardens, I would like my website to be a living representation of the work I have been doing, and not just a static page that hardly represents me.

I'm a restless Anthropologist who wanders, experiments, and seeks to understand different subjects, techniques, and perspectives through undisciplinary approaches that stem from the humanities and social sciences and extend into other fields of knowledge.

From this blend, while paying attention to details and being open to new learning opportunities with different beings (humans, non-humans, and more-than-humans), I explore various languages and artistic expressions through critical thinking and alterity.

That's why I took on the challenge of designing a site that can be browsed according to each person's interests, initially pointing out just a few places as a starting point for your trail:

> [!faq] Website Sections

* [[cv|CV:]] gathers my educational and professional information
* [[publications|Publications:]] all publications in which I have been an author or co-author
* [[audiovisual productions|Audiovisual Productions:]] all the audiovisual productions I have collaborated on
* [[workshops and courses|Workshops and Courses:]] workshops and courses I have given
* [[research|Research and Note-Taking:]] lists of references and notes for each piece of research I've been doing (for now available only in Brazilian Portuguese)

> [!text] Axes of thematic interest 

Although it is a long list, my research interests and projects encompass the following thematic axes:
