# Greeting, I'm Brenno Brandalise Demarchi, it's nice to see you here!

> [!text] This is not a curriculum, although it is

Inspired by the principles of Digital Gardens, I would like my website to be a living representation of the work I have been doing, and not just a static page that hardly represents me.

That's why I took on the challenge of designing a site that can be browsed according to each person's interests, initially pointing out just a few places as a starting point for your trail:

> [!faq] Website Sections

[[cv|CV:]] gathers my educational and professional information
[[publications|Publications:]] all publications in which I have been an author or co-author
[[content/en-us/about/audiovisual|Audiovisual Productions:]] all the audiovisual productions I have collaborated on
[[workshops and courses|Workshops:]]  all the workshops and courses I have given
[[research|Research and Note-Taking:]] lists of references and notes for each piece of research I've been doing (for now only in Brazilian Portuguese)

> [!text] A brief account of my wanderings

 Below you'll find out a little more about my perspective, my journey and the themes that surround my research interests and other projects.

I am an anthropologist who doesn't sit still and likes to wander, experiment and understand different subjects, techniques and perspectives from ~~transdisciplinary~~ _indisciplinary_ approaches that start from the human and social sciences and cross other fields of knowledge.

It is from this mixing that I experiment with different languages and artistic expressions through a critical sense and the relationship between theory and practice, challenging myself to seek different perspectives based on otherness, paying attention to detail and open to new possibilities of learning with beings from different species (human, non-human and more-than-human).

Although it's a long list, my research interests and projects encompass the following thematic axes:

- **ecology, environment and nature:** multi-species relations, solarpunk, agriculture, common goods, composting, waste and water;

- **infrastructures and territories:** wanderings, drifts, maps, borders, margins, (infra)structures, ruins, constructions, projects, circulation, walkability

- **Photography, cinema and audiovisual production: sounds and soundscapes, audio, noise, music, photography and documentaries.

- **design and information:** systems, networks, accessibility, interfaces, architectures, findability, connections, data, information, graphics, images, algorithms, models and graphs;

- **organization:** methodologies, techniques, processes and metrics for production, management and distribution in different contexts and scales for collectively self-managed projects.
