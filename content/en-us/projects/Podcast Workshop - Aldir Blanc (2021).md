# About

We held a free and 100% online Podcast Workshop, with the support of the Aldir Blanc Law - Alcides Mesquita Award, from the Municipal Government of Santos and the Federal Government.

The workshop aimed to teach all the steps to produce quality podcasts with few resources, from creating the script to distribute and promote your podcast channel. Participants produced an episode for the "Podcast de Marte" about the works of poets and artists from Santos and received a certificate upon completion.

The workshop initially had 20 available slots, but due to receiving 56 registrations, we expanded to two groups with 28 slots each, aiming to accommodate everyone. The first group took place on the 8th, 10th, and 12th, from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM, and the second group was held on the 15th, 17th, and 19th. Both were conducted in February 2021.
