# Reinventing the City: thoughts about the hip hop movement and its political insurgencies

The research, conducted through exploratory and bibliographic methods, reveals that Hip-Hop transforms segregated and exclusionary urban spaces into sites of protest, entertainment, and social advocacy, acting as urban activism that guides and raises awareness within the community.
