# About this Project

In this project, Ademir Demarchi (proponent), with the support of the Aldir Blanc Law - Alcides Mesquita Prize, from the Municipal Government of Santos and the Federal Government, made a selection and recording of poems of his own authorship that talk about his experience living in the city of Santos. They can be read in the book "Pirão de Sereia," published by Realejo Edições, produced with the Cultural Support Program of the Municipal Government of Santos, in 2010.

I was responsible for directing, sound recording, and video and audio editing, resulting in the production of a video and a podcast episode that constituted the counterpart of the project.
