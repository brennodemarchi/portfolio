# Summary

This research anthropologically analyzes the challenges related to water from three perspectives:

1. It examines the theories and practices underpinning methods of administration and technical standards to address water crises, highlighting the interrelationship between the concepts of crisis, system, and risk.

2. It investigates how water is presented in environmental education brochures from public and private organizations, arguing that many materials emphasize a quantitative approach and offer individualized solutions that limit our understanding of the problem.

4. It discusses the infrastructural problems related to water in Brazil, ranging from the importance of preserving riparian forests to ongoing contamination from pesticides and waste, and scrutinizes water losses throughout the distribution system.

# Methodology

To collect and produce the data, a bibliographic survey was conducted on the concepts of crisis, system, and risk, as well as references related to theories of value, environmental ethics, anthropology of water, and infrastructure. The materials consulted included awareness-raising brochures on water consumption, manuals of project management methodologies and crisis management, Brazilian technical standards on risk management, as well as various academic works and articles published in journals.
