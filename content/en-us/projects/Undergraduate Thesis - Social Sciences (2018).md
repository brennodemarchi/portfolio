# Abstract

This research, conducted as part of the requirements for obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from the São Paulo State University Júlio de Mesquita Filho, Marília campus, investigated urban mobility in Marília, in the Central-West region of São Paulo. Considering urban, social, political, cultural, and geographical aspects, with an emphasis on public transportation, the research highlighted the lack of urban infrastructure in the municipality, despite existing Brazilian laws. Using a qualitative and interdisciplinary approach, the research mapped transportation methods in the city, analyzed users' opinions on public transportation, and identified the challenges they face. Data collection included ethnophotography and questionnaires applied to users of the municipal bus terminal, based on the Benjaminian conception of understanding history against the grain. The analysis revealed that the inefficiency of public transportation is influenced by both the lack of enforcement of laws by municipal administrations and by local topographical conditions and urban design. It was concluded that creative solutions are needed to address the challenges of urban mobility and ensure the right to safe and efficient transportation.
