# About

The workshop aimed to provide participants with a general introduction to podcast production processes, through discussions about this media, areas of operation, content development, and its creative use as a means to share diverse knowledge and practices with minimal technological knowledge or resources.

# Methodology

There were three meetings, each lasting up to 2 hours. The first part was informative, while the second was dedicated to reviewing practical exercises for the next meeting and allowing participants to ask questions and discuss their proposals. As an assessment method, a conversation was proposed to gather expectations and final considerations about participation in the workshop.
