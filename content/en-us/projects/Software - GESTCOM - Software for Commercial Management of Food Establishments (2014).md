# About 

GESTCOM - Commercial Management was a software developed between February and June 2014 as part of the criteria for obtaining the title of Middle Level Technician in Computer Science (with emphasis on programming) at the State Technical School Arist√≥tteles Ferreira - Santos, SP, Brazil.

In this project, I was responsible for project management, interface design, and user experience (UI/UX Design), as well as reviewing the thesis text.

# Features

Assist in the management of emporiums and other commercial establishments in organizing orders placed by customers, calculating estimated delivery time and route alternatives, general mapping of deliveries made, inventory control, generating charts to identify the customers who consume the most, the best-selling products, so that the establishment manager does not lose more customers due to unrecorded orders or those delivered with missing products.
