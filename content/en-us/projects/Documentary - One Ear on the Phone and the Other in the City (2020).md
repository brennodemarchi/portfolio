# Context 

Documentary short resulting from the 7th NUPEPA/ImaRgens Workshop, at the University of São Paulo (Usp), in partnership with ICNOVA, at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, held between June 23rd and July 23rd, 2020.

After the production and distribution of this documentary, we published an article in "GIS – Gesto, Imagem e Som – Anthropology Magazine  of the University of São Paulo", about the experience of participating in this project, bringing some reflections and contributions to the discussion around soundscapes (_soundscapes_) and from Musicar Local.

# Synopsis

Making deliveries via apps is part of the reality of many Brazilians, including Brazilians who live in foreign countries. The film, in turn, addresses the lives of Brazilian riders who live in Dublin. In informal conversations with these delivery drivers, they tell the interviewer how music, podcasts and the sounds of the city both soothe and make their day-to-day work viable.
